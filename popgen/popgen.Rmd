## The smallest unit of evolution: Populations
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 48%;">

* **EVOLUTION: Change in *allele frequencies* in a population over generational time**
    + not the individual
 
<br/>

* **What is an ALLELE?**

<br/>

* **Expression of trait variation**
    + allelic differences among individuals
    + may lead to reproductive success in current environment, via selection
    + *allele frequencies* change in populations

## Viewing the world via one-locus and two alleles
<hr>

* **Locus: a region of DNA that encodes for a trait**
    + may be one or many genes

<br/>

* **Allele: a variant of a gene**
    + 'A' = ACTGATCCCGATCCCGATAAATAGG
    + sequence is transcibed into mRNA then translated to red pigment
    
<br/>

* **Other individuals have a different sequence at red pigment locus:**
    + 'a' = ACTGATCCCGATC**TT**GATAAATAGG
    + new allele 'a' gives white pigment

<br/>

* **Letters 'A' and 'a' indicate there are two different alleles at this locus in the population**
    + *Homozygous* or *Heterozygous* (2 copies on paried chromosomes)

## Phenotypic variation reflects genetic variation
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

* **Some heritable phenotypes occur as 'either-or'**
    + red or white pigment
    + single gene locus, 2 alleles

<br/>

* **Phenotypes may be a gradient or determined by many genes**
    + incomplete dominance 
    + homozygous = red/white; hetero = pink

<br/>

* **Changes in genetic variation, via alleles, provide the raw materials for evolution**
    + inherit one copy of locus from mother & father
    + environment selects flower color phenotypes

## Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited genetic disease
<hr>
<br/>

* **People with CF have inherited 2 copies of the defective CFTR gene**
    + people with only one copy are called carriers, but no disease

<br/>

* **The defective gene is from a 'mutation'**
    + 1,700 known mutations of CFTR
    + deletions, early termination codons, point mutations

<br/>

* **Broken CFTR:**
    + misfolded and not in membrane
    + cannot open channel gate
    + insufficient quantites

    + 50% of gemetes have a allele

## Does Hardy Weinberg occur in nature? .... Kinda
<hr>
<br/>

* **Allele and genetic frequencies *do* change over time in populations**

<br/>

* **It is common for some loci to be in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium**
    + selection is likely happening on many loci
 
<br/>

* **Populations can evolve *very* slowly**
    + really low mutations rates
    + makes it hard to detect frequency change in alleles
    
<br/>

* **HW becomes useful to determine the % of a population carrying a specific allele**
    + medical science &rarr; inherited diseases &rarr; Cystis Fibrosis

## **In Switzerland there are 5 people born with Cystic Fibrosis (aa) out of every 10,000 children. Assuming the Swiss population is not evolving at the locus for the CFTR gene:**

<br/>

**What is the frequency of broken CFTR allele?**

<br/>

**What is the frequency of the normal CFTR allele?**

<br/>

**What are the expected frequencies of the 3 genotypes of the CFTR gene that determines Cystic Fibrosis in the Swiss population**

<br/>

**Due to modern medicine, Cystic Fibrosis is no longer fatal to children.  Explain how population genetics should/should not be used monitor CF in Swiss people, through time.**

## A population of otters has 336 brown and 64 tan individuals. The brown allele is dominant and the tan allele is recessive. The groundhogs appear to be in Hardy Weingberge equilbrium at the fur color locus

<br/>

**How many otters in this population are heterzygous?**

<br/>

**One year later, we observed 650 otters in the same location. How many individuals would you expect to be brown, assumming our population did not evolve?**
